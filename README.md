# AI-ML-Resources

The AI-ML-Resources file summarizes low cost or free resources to develop competencies in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data sciece, and other sub-fields of AI.  You'll find specific course suggestions, with an empahsis 
on the `AI for Everyone` class from www.coursera.org, and the `Complete Machine Learning and Data Science Bootcamp 2021` course from www.udemy.com. Completing both of those courses will provide a good foundation both conceptually and technically. Upon completion you'll also have a clearer idea of what to learn next (e.g., deep learning, NLP, computer vision, etc.).  While we may be lacking in the non-proprietary risk and control frameworks department for the AI space, you may find value in the CRISP-DM framework.  Check out the following ISACA blog post from Andrew Clark for more details (https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2018/volume-1/the-machine-learning-auditcrisp-dm-framework). 

**Happy Learning**
